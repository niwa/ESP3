Calibration of Channel GPT  38 kHz 0090720580ea 2-1 ES38B recorded on  26/08/2016 22:49:22
Processed on the 13/11/2023 13:32:58 using ESP3 version 10000.0.0 Do not use for integration
Ping rate = 4.7616 Hz
Mean sphere depth= 24.1938 m
Sound speed at sphere = 1500 m/s
Density at sphere = 1026.6982 kg/m^3
Mean Absorption = 8.4143 dB/km
Mean sound speed = 1500 m/s
Sphere TS at 38 kHz is -42.4158 dB


Mean ts within 0.21 deg of centre = -41.2331 dB
Std of ts within 0.21 deg of centre = 0.12628 dB
Maximum TS within 0.21 deg of centre = -40.9043 dB
Number of echoes within 0.21 deg of centre = 376
On axis TS from beam fitting = -41.1702 dB

Hence Ex60 is reading 1.1827 dB too high (mean method)
So add 0.59135 dB to G_o (mean method)
G_o from .raw file is 25.81 dB
So the calibrated G_o = 26.4014 dB (mean method)

Hence Ex60 is reading 1.5115 dB too high (max method)
So add 0.75576 dB to G_o (max method)
G_o from .raw file is 25.81 dB
So the calibrated G_o = 26.5658 dB (max method)

Hence Ex60 is reading 1.2457 dB too high (beam fitting method)
So add 0.62283 dB to G_o (beam fitting method)
G_o from .raw file is 25.81 dB
So the calibrated G_o = 26.4328 dB (beam fitting method)

Mean sphere range = 25.2689 m, std = 0.83588 m

So sa correction = -0.61437 dB
(the effective pulse length = 0.75357 * nominal pulse length)

Fore/aft beamwidth = 7.0771 degrees
Fore/aft offset = 0.086951 degrees (to be subtracted from angles)
Port/stbd beamwidth = 7.1972 degrees
Port/stbd offset = -0.099386 degrees (to be subtracted from angles)
New EBA estimated at = -20.0054 dB
Results obtained from 16013 sphere echoes
Using c = 1500 m/s
Using absorption = 9.7575 dB/km

RMS of fit to beam model out to 7.1371 degrees = 0.10507 dB
